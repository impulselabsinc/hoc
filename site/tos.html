            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            
            <p>Last Revised:  December 5, 2014</p>
            
            <p>Code.org is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization (“Code.org”). Our mission is to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science. As a part of that mission, Code.org operates the web sites located at <a href="http://code.org">http://code.org</a>, <a href="http://csedweek.org">http://csedweek.org</a>, <a href="http://computinginthecore.org">http://computinginthecore.org</a>, <a href="http://hourofcode.com">http://hourofcode.com</a>, other websites, information, text, curricula, videos, graphics, photos, APIs, email notifications and other materials and related products and services (the “<strong>Services</strong>”), including the tutorial platform at <a href="http://studio.code.org">http://studio.code.org</a> (“<strong>Code Studio</strong>”).</p>
            
            <p>Please read these Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) carefully before accessing or using the Services. Accessing or using any part of the Services or clicking on an “I Agree” or “Sign Up” button that may be made available to you means that you agree to be bound by these Terms without modification.</p>
            
            <p>These Terms are a legal contract between you and Code.org regarding your use of the Services. You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Code.org and are not a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.</p>
            
            <p>These Terms are subject to change. You are agreeing to be bound by such changes if you continue to use to the Services after these Terms change, so please check these Terms for changes periodically.</p>
            
            <h2>Additional Terms</h2>
            
            <p>Some Services may be subject to additional posted guidelines, rules or terms of service (“<strong>Additional Terms</strong>”) and your use of such Services will be conditioned on your agreement to the Additional Terms. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control for that Service, unless the Additional Terms expressly state that these Terms will control.</p>
            
            <h3>Children Under Age 13</h3>
            
            <p>We take steps to minimize the collection of personal data from Users under the age of 13 as explained in the Code.org <a href="http://code.org/privacy">privacy policy</a>. If you are under the age of 13, we encourage you to get the approval of a parent or legal guardian before creating an account on Code.org.
            Code.org allows certain representatives of school districts and schools, such as teachers, administrators, counselors, and other educators (a “<strong>Educator</strong>”) to connect with students through the Services in order to provide tutorial, educational and similar services. If you are an Educator, you may register accounts on the Services for one or more of your students.</p>
            
            <p>If you are an Educator and you register an account for a student who is under the age of 13 (a “<strong>Child</strong>”), you represent and warrant that you or the educational organization you work for has proper permission to register the Child for educational services, such as Code.org, that collect some of the Child’s personal information for the use and benefit of the school and for no other commercial purpose. In addition, you agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of the educational organization you work for.</p>

If you are an Educator who chooses to ask for the assistance of a volunteer sourced via Code.org’s database, it is entirely your responsibility to thoroughly check references or perform the necessary background checks. Code.org provides no warranty or information other than the ability to contact a potential volunteer, and all liability in any use of volunteers rests only with you. Code.org does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by volunteers and we neither adopt nor endorse, nor are we responsible for, the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice, or statement made by any party other than Code.org. Under no circumstances is Code.org responsible for any loss or damage resulting from any person's reliance on information or other content posted on the Service or transmitted by others.</p>
            
            <h3>Pledges, Donations and Payments</h3>
            
            <p>A. Pledges and Donations. If you make a pledge or donation on this website, You agree to pay all pledges and donations specified.</p>
            
            <p>B. Payment Methods. Code.org will charge the pledge or donation you authorized, if any, to the PayPal account or credit card you designate. You authorize the credit card or PayPal account you designate to pay any amounts described herein and authorize Code.org, or any other company that acts as a billing agent for Code.org, to continue to attempt to charge all sums described herein to your credit card or PayPal account until such pledge or donation are paid in full.</p>
            
            <p>C. Credit Card Authorization. If you use a credit card to pay for any pledge or donation related to the Website, You will be asked to provide Code.org with a credit card number from a card issuer that we accept. Code.org may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account to verify the credit card is valid and/or has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your pledge or donation. These pre-authorizations will reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge. Please contact your credit card issuer if you have additional questions regarding when an authorization amount will be removed from your statement.</p>
