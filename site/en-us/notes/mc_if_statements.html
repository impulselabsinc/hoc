<p>All computers use if statements, including my phone. For example, when I unlock my phone, it runs some code that says if I enter the password correctly, then unlock the phone. Otherwise, it shows an error message.</p>

<p>You can use if statements in your code to make Steve and Alice react to what they see in the world. For example, if there is a rock in front of them, they can turn left. Or turn right if they run into a tree.</p>

<p>After we mine the stone, we'll need to check if there's any lava in that place before moving forward. If there is lava there, we want to place a stone in front of our character before we can move forward. That way we can safely move on. Time for more mining! And remember to use the if statement to watch your step.</p>
