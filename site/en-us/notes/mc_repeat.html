<p>I'm Lydia Winters, Mojang's brand director and we made a little game called Minecraft.</p>

<p>My favorite thing to do in Minecraft is explore. I love adventuring in caves and seeing what I can find. As someone who isn't a programmer, I'm really excited to go through the Minecraft lesson and actually learn some coding myself.</p>

<p>The last level needed lots of moveForward(); blocks. It would be easier if we could just tell the computer to perform the moveForward(); command four or five times. Luckily for us, computers are really good at repeating commands with repeat loops.</p>

<p>When building Minecraft, we use repeat loops to place all the initial materials for creating a new world. That's thousands and thousands of blocks. We also use loops in little ways, for example to make Alex's feet move back and forth as she walks. Repeat loops are a powerful part of programming.</p>

<p>Night is coming so in the next couple of levels, we're going to build a house to stay safe. We're going to use the repeat block to do this very easily.</p>

<p>To build a wall of our house, we can either tell Alex to moveForward(); and place planks four times or we can tell her to moveForward(); and place one plank, then take this command and use the repeat block to have her perform the action multiple times. Now we'll click on the repeat block and tell her how many times we want her to perform this action. Now let's build our house before night falls! Have fun.</p>
